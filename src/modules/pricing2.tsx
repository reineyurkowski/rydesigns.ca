      <h2> Pricing Info </h2>
      <p>
      As a multi-disciplinary professional, I have experience in web development, 
      design, audio production, video production, and more. 
      <br/> <br/>
      My diverse skill set 
      allows me to take a holistic approach to projects, ensuring that every aspect 
      is well-crafted and aligned with the overall goals. However, due to the high 
      level of dynamicism and unique needs of each project, I am unable to provide 
      a fixed quote upfront. 
      <br/><br/>
      Instead, I believe in working closely with each customer 
      to fully understand their needs and provide a tailored solution. By taking the 
      time to understand the project goals, I can provide accurate and fair quotes that 
      reflect the level of effort and resources required. 
      <br/><br/>
      I value transparency and open 
      communication with my customers and am always happy to discuss project details 
      in person, over the phone, by email, or video call.
